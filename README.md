# Google Apps Script — Spreadsheet Workflow Automation

A sanitized code sample of Google Apps Script utilities used to automate recurring spreadsheet workflows:
routing rows, applying template logic, and exporting data to CSV.

## What this demonstrates
- Practical automation for reducing repetitive manual work
- Menu-driven tooling and workflow actions
- Data transformation and CSV export logic

## Files
- `USR.gs` — workflow utilities and menu actions
- `SendToTemplateSheet.gs` — routes data into template sheets
- `DownloadCSV.gs` — exports template sheets to CSV and saves to Drive, allows download options

## Note on sanitization
This is a generalized, sanitized version:
sheet names, URLs, and IDs are replaced with placeholders.
